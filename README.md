This is my case project created for Front-end school 2.0:

Completed tasks:
-	Set up a landing page for the website.
-	Created courses.js page that displays information about the courses (courses` photos, titles, rating, skills, number of lessons).
-	Added pagination to display 10 courses on each page (in total we got 3 pages).
Page with all courses can be reached upon clicking on “Go to courses” button on main page, courses link in web-site header, or “Explore all” on main page's sidebar.
After clicking on any course a course.js page will load with specified course`s data.
-	The course-preview video will automatically play after page has loaded.
-	In the Lessons panel you can select another lesson and after clicking it the corresponding video will play.
-	After finishing the lesson there will be a message notifying you that the lesson has ended.
-	Progress of watched video is saved in local storage even after switching to another course
-	User can see which video is playing by looking into the “Now playing” field. 
-	If the lesson is locked user will be informed about that and the video will not play.
